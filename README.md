# chess-c

CheSSH is a terminal based SSH game of chess you can play with friends or against bots. Right now I haven't quite completed the ssh functinonality but the full game of chess and the bot is complete at a barebones level.

The bot probably plays at about a 1300 ELO rating as of now, but because I made the game from scratch, it allows room for it to be as strong as 2500 rated. I can't wait to add multiplayer and hopefully I'll be able to add a highseas update before it ends!
