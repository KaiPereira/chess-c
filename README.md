# chess-c

CheSSH is a terminal based SSH game of chess you can play with friends or against bots. Right now I haven't quite completed the ssh functinonality but the full game of chess and the bot is complete at a barebones level.

## Things I could/could've improved

Used an enum for moves, because I use matrix coordinates like board[x][y]
